# _Binary and Real Adaptive Boosting Algorithms_

_Description: Adaptive boosting(AdaBoost) algorithms are used by many other machine learning algorithms to improve their performance. Algorithm combines several weak hypothesis to create stronger hypothesis among them. I have implemented java program for binary and real adaptive boosting algorithms. You can know more about adaptive boosting at:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost#Overview_

## Project Setup

_How do I, as a developer, start working on the project?_ 

1. _What dependencies does it have (where are they expressed) and how do I install them?_
A. _It doesn't have any dependencies.
2. _How can I see the project working before I change anything?_
A. _Just run run the code in Eclipse.

## Deploying

### _How to setup the deployment environment_

- _Required Eclipse with jdk 1.6 or higher_

### _What is input and output files for project?_

- _Input is text file. Sample dataset is attached in project_

- _First element of first line is number of iterations for program_

- _Second element of first line is number of elements._

- _Third element of first line is Ebsilon value_

- _Second, Third and fourth lines are element names,associated values and probability of each elements. _

- _Output is boosted hypothesis._
